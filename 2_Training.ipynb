    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The CNN-RNN model is relatively simple. I did not change the encoder (CNN), so it is the ResNet50 model that has been provided to me in this project. The decoder (RNN) is an LSTM RNN, with one Linear layer after the hidden layer. The LSTM has, by default, only one hidden layer, but that value can be changed with the appropriate argument in the initalization function. The Linear layer of the decoder outputs the most probable next word from the vocabulary. I searched through a few research papers, some of which were provided in the descriptions of this project. However, in the end, I chose to follow the LSTM implementation that was laid out in the previous lesson from this course. \n",
    "Again after researching multiple online sources and papers which were provided in the above section, I decided to set the parameters as can be seen below. After multiple tries and tweaking of the parameters I decided to set the parameters as follows. I set the `embed_size` parameter to 256 (the same as in the previous notebook), the `hidden_size` parameter to 512 (also the same as in the previous notebook), the `vocab_threshold` to 5 and the `batch_size` to 64. After a few test I concluded that when the `vocab_threshold` parameter is set to 5 it produces the most satisfactory results, since more words can be included in the vocabulary, therefore the model can produce more accurate results. I followed a similar logic with the `batch_size` parameter. After a few test, I decided to set the parameter to 64, which produced the most satisfactory results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE** I originaly trained the model with 2 epochs, as I was still testing the model. That gave good results which can be seen in the next notebook, 3_Inference. However, I wanted to finally train the model with 3 epochs, but I encountered a problem in the training which I believe is beyond the subject of this project, and it involves an error in the http request header. Since the test model, which was trained with only 2 epochs was working well, I decided to keep it that way. That is why below the number of epochs is 2, and there is an error in the step 2 section of this notebook, with additional comments to explain the problem further.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** I left the `transform_train` transform the same as its provided value. I decided to keep it that way because the provided values had a good size and random crop value, neither too big, which would make the training process significantly more dificult and longer, neither too small, which would not give enough information about the contents of the image. Also, I decided to keep the random horizontal flip function to introduce some randomness in the images that are passed through the encoder. Due to the fact that I kept the rest of the transforms to their provided values, I had to keep the Normalize() transform the same as the provided value as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** I decided to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder trainable, so the same as described in the Task #3 section. I did not feel the need to additionally train the weights of the Convolutional layer of the encoder, since it already uses the pretrained ResNet50 model, that has been trained on much larger datasets than those used, or provided in this project \n",
    ".\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** I selected the Adam optimizer because it is one of the most popular and one of the most versatile optimizers that PyTorch offers. I am also the most familiar with it and how it works. I decided to first try the Adam optimizer and it provided satisfactory results during the training process."

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, if you would like to go above and beyond in this project, you can read about some approaches to minimizing overfitting in section 4.3.1 of [this paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7505636).  In the next (optional) step of this notebook, we provide some guidance for assessing the performance on the validation dataset."

    "The following error that can be seen above is a problem with an authentication header in the http request to an AWS service that Udacity uses in this project. I did not know how to solve this issue, but seeing as this issue only occurred recently, and I had previously already trained the model on 2 epochs (but I wanted to retrain it on 3 epochs before I submitted the project, in order for everything to be clean and nicely layed out) and that model was working well, I decide to submit the project with the following error. I realize that one of the main parts of the rubric is to show how the training went, but I do not know how to fix this issue, which I think is unrelated to the subject of this project. Therefore, I am submitting this project with the following error. I sincerely hope you can still grade my project without seeing the training process."

    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",

    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",

    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
